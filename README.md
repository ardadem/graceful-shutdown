# Graceful Shutdown

It's a simple bash script to shutdown gracefully for my i3.

## Installation and Usage

First you need to install dependencies

Debian/Ubuntu

```
apt install wmctrl
```

Arch Linux

```
pacman -S wmctrl
```

then clone this repository and set script as executable.

```
chmod +x graceful_shutdown.sh
```

You can execute it now!

**NOTE:** You may want to edit ```APPLIST TO KILL``` in script.
